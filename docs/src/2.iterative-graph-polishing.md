# Iterative Graph polishing


For graph polishing
take the smallest K at which you see singletons, and for reeds containing those
singletons find a new optimal path through the graph to replace those
singletons. In the next iteration increase the K to the next Prime number K
less than 64 and again determine all cameras that are singletons and in each
read containing those singletons find a new path through the graph that removes
those single tenant. After we have reached a K of 63 or after we have stopped
making edits we should have a rived at a polished graph where each read has
been graph corrected to its optimization maximization no expectation max my
expectation maximize ation likelihood where this is a greedy graph-based
approach of figuring out which graph is most likely given the input data.

Explain hear what
else we have tried and one thing that weâ€™ve tried is the Viterbi algorithm
which is simply too slow given that we have to compute too many combinations
are possible paths, however in theory this is the best statistical approach to
be taken to robustly solve this problem.
