# API Documentation

Welcome to the Mycelia API documentation! This guide organizes both **implemented functions** and **planned features** by biological workflows. Note that Mycelia is in early development - many documented functions represent the intended API design but are not yet implemented.

## üß¨ Quick Start

New to Mycelia? Start with our workflow-based guides:

- **[Basic Workflows](api/examples/basic-workflows.md)** - Common analysis patterns
- **[Function Index](api/quick-reference/function-index.md)** - Alphabetical function list
- **[Parameter Guide](api/quick-reference/parameter-guide.md)** - Common parameters explained

## üìã By Workflow Stage

## üí° Usage Patterns

### Function Documentation Format
Each function is documented with:

```julia
"""
    function_name(required_param, optional_param="default")

Brief description of what the function does.

## Purpose
When and why to use this function in your workflow.

## Arguments
- `required_param`: Description and expected data type
- `optional_param`: Description, default value, and alternatives

## Returns
Description of return value and structure.

## Examples
```julia
# Basic usage
result = function_name("input.fasta")

# Advanced usage with options
result = function_name("input.fasta", 
                      optional_param="custom_value",
                      threads=4)
```

## Related Functions
- [`related_function`](@ref) - What it does
- [`workflow_next_step`](@ref) - Next step in workflow

## Performance Notes
- Memory usage: ~X GB for typical datasets
- Runtime: ~X minutes for Y-sized genomes
- Scaling: Linear/quadratic with input size

## üöÄ Integration with Tutorials

This API documentation integrates with the tutorial system:

- **Tutorials** show complete workflows with explanation
- **API docs** provide detailed function reference
- **Examples** bridge the gap with focused use cases

For hands-on learning, see the [Tutorials](../tutorials.md) which use these functions in complete bioinformatics workflows.
