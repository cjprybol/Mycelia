Mycelia builds upon and complements several excellent projects in the graph genomics and bioinformatics space. This page acknowledges these tools and tracks their integration status with Mycelia.

## Graph Genomics Tools

#### [vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg)
The variation graph toolkit - a comprehensive suite for working with genome variation graphs. Mycelia wraps vg's core functionality for graph construction, manipulation, and analysis.

#### [PGGB](https://github.com/pangenome/pggb)
PanGenome Graph Builder - a pipeline for constructing pangenome variation graphs from genome assemblies. Combines wfmash, seqwish, smoothxg, odgi, and gfaffix.

#### [ODGI](https://github.com/pangenome/odgi)
Optimized Dynamic Genome/Graph Implementation - tools for analyzing and manipulating genome variation graphs. Provides graph optimization, visualization, and path analysis.

#### [MetaGraph](https://github.com/ratschlab/metagraph)
A scalable framework for indexing and querying large-scale genomic databases using annotated de Bruijn graphs.

#### [PanTools](https://git.wur.nl/bioinformatics/pantools)
Computational pan-genomics toolkit with a focus on database-driven pangenome analysis and comparative genomics.

#### [pangene](https://github.com/lh3/pangene)
Li Heng's tool for pangenome gene annotation - extracts and analyzes genes across multiple genomes in a pangenome context.

#### [Graphein](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein)
Protein Graph Library - converts protein structures and interaction networks into graph representations for machine learning and network analysis.
