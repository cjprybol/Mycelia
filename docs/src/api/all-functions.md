# Complete API Surface

```@meta
CurrentModule = Mycelia
```

This page is generated directly from the package docstrings so every documented function, type, and constant available in the current codebase is visible in one place. Use this as a coverage checklist when adding new functionality: if a symbol is missing here, it either lacks a docstring or has not been included in the documentation build pipeline.

## Index of All Documented Symbols

```@index
Modules = [Mycelia]
```

## Detailed Reference (auto-generated)

```@autodocs
Modules = [Mycelia]
Order = [:type, :function, :macro, :constant]
Private = false
```

### Keeping the API Complete

- **Implemented, documented functions** will appear above. Add docstrings in the source files to include new symbols automatically.
- **Experimental or deprecated functions** are included for transparency; mark them in their docstrings accordingly.
- **Planned functions** should be captured in the [Workflow & Tool Map](../workflow-map.md) until they are implemented and documented.
