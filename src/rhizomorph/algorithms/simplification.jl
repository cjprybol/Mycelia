# Graph Simplification Algorithms
#
# This file contains algorithms for simplifying assembly graphs by:
# - Detecting and resolving bubbles (alternative paths)
# - Removing low-coverage paths
# - Collapsing linear chains
# - Removing tips (dead ends)
#
# Based on functions from src/sequence-graphs-next.jl

"""
Represents a bubble (alternative path) in the assembly graph.

A bubble occurs when the graph splits into two or more alternative paths
that later rejoin. Bubbles often represent:
- SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms)
- Small indels
- Sequencing errors
- Strain variation

# Fields
- `entry_vertex`: Vertex where paths diverge
- `exit_vertex`: Vertex where paths reconverge
- `path1`: First alternative path
- `path2`: Second alternative path
- `path1_support`: Coverage/support for path 1
- `path2_support`: Coverage/support for path 2
- `complexity_score`: Measure of bubble complexity (higher = more complex)

"""
    detect_bubbles_next(graph::MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph; min_bubble_length::Int=2, max_bubble_length::Int=100)

Detect bubble structures (alternative paths) in the assembly graph.

# Arguments
- `graph::MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph`: The assembly graph to analyze
- `min_bubble_length::Int`: Minimum bubble path length (default: 2)
- `max_bubble_length::Int`: Maximum bubble path length (default: 100)

# Returns
- `Vector{BubbleStructure}`: Detected bubbles

# Algorithm
1. Find vertices with out-degree > 1 (potential bubble entry points)
2. Trace paths from each outgoing edge
3. Check if paths reconverge within max_bubble_length
4. Validate bubble structure and calculate support scores
5. Remove duplicate detections

# Example
```julia
graph = build_kmer_graph_next(Kmers.DNAKmer{31}, records)
bubbles = detect_bubbles_next(graph, min_bubble_length=2, max_bubble_length=50)
```

    simplify_graph_next(graph::MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph, bubbles::Vector{BubbleStructure})

Simplify the graph by resolving bubbles and removing low-confidence paths.

# Arguments
- `graph::MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph`: Graph to simplify

# Returns

# Strategy
For each bubble:
1. Compare support scores for alternative paths
2. If one path has significantly higher support, remove the other
3. If support is similar, keep both paths (potential variation)
