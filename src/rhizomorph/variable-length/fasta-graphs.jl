# Variable-length FASTA Graph Construction
#
# Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) graphs for variable-length FASTA sequences.
#
# This module provides graph construction functions for variable-length biological
# sequence assembly using the OLC approach where complete BioSequences are vertices
# and edges represent suffix-prefix overlaps.
#
# Key Features:
# - Stores complete BioSequences as vertices (NOT strings)
# - Odd-length overlaps only (unambiguous resolution)
# - Evidence tracking with nested Dict structure
# - Suitable for assembly from contigs, scaffolds, or reads
#
# Use Cases:
# - Contig/scaffold assembly
# - Sequence overlap analysis
# - Reference-free assembly
#
# Based on rhizomorph-graph-ecosystem-plan.md Section 2.2

    build_fasta_graph(records; dataset_id="dataset_01", min_overlap=3)

Build variable-length FASTA graph using Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approach.

This is the main user-facing function for variable-length FASTA graph construction.
Unlike k-mer graphs, this stores COMPLETE BioSequences as vertices and connects them
based on suffix-prefix overlaps.

# Arguments
- `records::Vector{FASTX.FASTA.Record}`: Input FASTA records
- `dataset_id::String="dataset_01"`: Dataset identifier for evidence tracking
- `min_overlap::Int=3`: Minimum overlap length (must be odd)

# Returns
- `MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph`: Variable-length FASTA graph with BioSequence vertices

# Key Concepts
- **Vertices**: Complete BioSequences (LongDNA, LongRNA, or LongAA)
- **Edges**: Suffix-prefix overlaps between sequences
- **Overlap Requirement**: Only odd-length overlaps allowed
- **Evidence**: Tracks which sequences overlap and where

# Examples
```julia
# Load contigs from assembly
records = collect(open_fastx("contigs.fasta"))
graph = build_fasta_graph(records; min_overlap=7)

# Get statistics
stats = get_fasta_graph_statistics(graph)
println("Found \$(stats[:num_vertices]) sequences with \$(stats[:num_edges]) overlaps")

# Find overlap paths
for (src, dst) in MetaGraphsNext.edge_labels(graph)
    edge_data = graph[src, dst]
    println("Overlap: \$(length(src))bp â†’ \$(length(dst))bp (\$(edge_data.overlap_length)bp)")
end
```

# Use Cases

**Contig Assembly:**
```julia
# Assemble overlapping contigs
contigs = collect(open_fastx("assembly.fasta"))
graph = build_fasta_graph(contigs; min_overlap=15)
# Find paths through the graph to scaffold contigs
```

**Sequence Overlap Analysis:**
```julia
# Find which sequences overlap
seqs = collect(open_fastx("sequences.fasta"))
graph = build_fasta_graph(seqs; min_overlap=9)
```
