# Variable-length FASTQ Graph Construction
#
# Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) graphs for variable-length FASTQ sequences with quality.
#
# This module provides graph construction functions for variable-length biological
# sequence assembly using the OLC approach where complete BioSequences are vertices
# with quality information preserved.
#
# Key Features:
# - Stores complete BioSequences as vertices (NOT strings)
# - Quality scores preserved for each sequence
# - Odd-length overlaps only (unambiguous resolution)
# - Evidence tracking with nested Dict structure
# - Suitable for quality-aware assembly from reads
#
# Use Cases:
# - Quality-aware read assembly
# - High-confidence overlap detection
# - Error-aware sequence assembly
#
# Based on rhizomorph-graph-ecosystem-plan.md Section 2.2

    build_fastq_graph(records; dataset_id="dataset_01", min_overlap=3)

Build variable-length FASTQ graph using Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approach.

This is the main user-facing function for variable-length FASTQ graph construction.
Unlike qualmer graphs, this stores COMPLETE BioSequences as vertices and connects them
based on suffix-prefix overlaps, preserving quality information.

# Arguments
- `records::Vector{FASTX.FASTQ.Record}`: Input FASTQ records
- `dataset_id::String="dataset_01"`: Dataset identifier for evidence tracking
- `min_overlap::Int=3`: Minimum overlap length (must be odd)

# Returns
- `MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph`: Variable-length FASTQ graph with BioSequence vertices and quality

# Key Concepts
- **Vertices**: Complete BioSequences (LongDNA or LongRNA) with quality
- **Edges**: Suffix-prefix overlaps between sequences
- **Overlap Requirement**: Only odd-length overlaps allowed
- **Evidence**: Tracks which sequences overlap with quality scores

# Examples
```julia
# Load reads
records = collect(open_fastx("reads.fastq.gz"))
graph = build_fastq_graph(records; min_overlap=7)

# Get statistics
stats = get_fastq_graph_statistics(graph)
println("Found \$(stats[:num_vertices]) sequences with \$(stats[:num_edges]) overlaps")
println("Mean quality: \$(stats[:mean_quality])")

# Find high-quality overlap paths
for (src, dst) in MetaGraphsNext.edge_labels(graph)
    edge_data = graph[src, dst]
    println("Overlap: \$(length(src))bp â†’ \$(length(dst))bp (\$(edge_data.overlap_length)bp)")
end
```

# Use Cases

**Quality-aware Assembly:**
```julia
# Assemble reads with quality tracking
reads = collect(open_fastx("reads.fastq.gz"))
graph = build_fastq_graph(reads; min_overlap=15)
# Use quality scores to select best assembly paths
```

**High-confidence Overlap Detection:**
```julia
# Find only high-quality overlaps
reads = collect(open_fastx("reads.fastq.gz"))
graph = build_fastq_graph(reads; min_overlap=21)
```

- `get_fastq_graph_statistics`: Get graph statistics including quality
