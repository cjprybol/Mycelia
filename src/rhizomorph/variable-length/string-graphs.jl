# Variable-length String Graph Construction
#
# Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) graphs for variable-length strings.
#
# This module provides graph construction functions for variable-length string
# assembly using the OLC approach where complete strings are vertices and edges
# represent suffix-prefix overlaps.
#
# Key Features:
# - Stores complete strings as vertices (not fixed-length substrings)
# - Odd-length overlaps only (unambiguous resolution)
# - Evidence tracking with nested Dict structure
# - Suitable for assembly from reads, not pattern analysis
#
# Use Cases:
# - Read assembly from sequencing data (after string conversion)
# - Text fragment reconstruction
# - Sequence overlap analysis
#
# Based on rhizomorph-graph-ecosystem-plan.md Section 2.2

    build_string_graph(strings; dataset_id="dataset_01", min_overlap=3)

Build variable-length string graph using Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approach.

This is the main user-facing function for variable-length string graph construction.
Unlike n-gram graphs, this stores COMPLETE strings as vertices and connects them
based on suffix-prefix overlaps.

# Arguments
- `strings::Vector{String}`: Input strings (complete sequences)
- `dataset_id::String="dataset_01"`: Dataset identifier for evidence tracking
- `min_overlap::Int=3`: Minimum overlap length (must be odd)

# Returns
- `MetaGraphsNext.MetaGraph`: Variable-length string graph with overlap evidence

# Key Concepts
- **Vertices**: Complete strings (not fixed-length substrings)
- **Edges**: Suffix-prefix overlaps between strings
- **Overlap Requirement**: Only odd-length overlaps allowed
- **Evidence**: Tracks which strings overlap and where

# Examples
```julia
# Assembly-like scenario
reads = ["ATCGATCG", "TCGATCGA", "GATCGATT", "CGATTGCC"]
graph = build_string_graph(reads; min_overlap=5)

# Get statistics
stats = get_string_graph_statistics(graph)
println("Found \$(stats[:num_vertices]) strings with \$(stats[:num_edges]) overlaps")

# Find overlap paths
for (src, dst) in MetaGraphsNext.edge_labels(graph)
    edge_data = graph[src, dst]
    println("Overlap: \$src â†’ \$dst (\$(edge_data.overlap_length) chars)")
end
```

# Use Cases

**Read Assembly:**
```julia
# Assemble overlapping reads
reads = ["ATCGATCG", "TCGATCGA", "GATCGATT"]
graph = build_string_graph(reads; min_overlap=5)
# Find assembly paths through the graph
```

**Text Reconstruction:**
```julia
# Reconstruct text from fragments
fragments = ["hello wor", "orld is", "is beautiful"]
graph = build_string_graph(fragments; min_overlap=3)
```
