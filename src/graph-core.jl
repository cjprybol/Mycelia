Strand orientation for k-mer observations and transitions.
- `Forward`: k-mer as observed (5' to 3')
- `Reverse`: reverse complement of k-mer (3' to 5')

Graph mode for handling strand information.
- `SingleStrand`: Sequences are single-stranded (RNA, amino acids, or directional DNA)
- `DoubleStrand`: Sequences are double-stranded DNA/RNA with canonical representation
