Find optimal path through k-mer graph using genomic-optimized Dijkstra's algorithm.

This implementation is specifically optimized for genomic k-mer graphs with:
- **Coverage-based edge weights**: Higher coverage k-mers receive lower costs
- **Canonical k-mer handling**: Automatic forward/reverse complement normalization
- **Biological constraints**: Only considers valid k-mer transitions (k-1 overlaps)

# Arguments
- `graph::AbstractGraph`: K-mer de Bruijn graph
- `source::Int`: Source k-mer index
- `target::Int`: Target k-mer index  
- `kmers::Vector{T}`: Vector of k-mers corresponding to graph vertices
- `kmer_coverage::Dict{T, Int}`: Coverage counts for each k-mer

# Returns
`GenomicPathResult{T}`: Optimal path with comprehensive analysis metrics

# Algorithm Details
1. **Edge Weight Calculation**: `cost = 1 + (1 - coverage_weight)` where coverage_weight ∈ [0,1]
2. **Priority Queue**: Min-heap prioritizing low-cost paths
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Traces back optimal path from target to source
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Based on average k-mer coverage along path

# Edge Weight Formula
```
coverage_weight = kmer_coverage[kmer] / max_coverage
edge_cost = 1.0 + (1.0 - coverage_weight)
```
This gives costs in range [1, 2] with higher coverage → lower cost.

# Examples
```julia
# Find optimal assembly path between k-mers
graph, kmers = build_kmer_graph(sequences, 31)
coverage = count_kmer_coverage(sequences, kmers)

source_idx = findfirst(==(kmer1), kmers)
target_idx = findfirst(==(kmer2), kmers) 

result = genomic_dijkstra(graph, source_idx, target_idx, kmers, coverage)
optimal_sequence = reconstruct_sequence(result.path, 31)

Find optimal path using bidirectional search optimized for genomic graphs.

This algorithm simultaneously searches from source and target (reverse complement),
meeting in the middle for significant performance improvements on long genomic paths.

# Arguments
- `graph::AbstractGraph`: K-mer de Bruijn graph
- `source::Int`: Source k-mer index
- `target::Int`: Target k-mer index
- `kmers::Vector{T}`: Vector of k-mers corresponding to graph vertices  
- `kmer_coverage::Dict{T, Int}`: Coverage counts for each k-mer

# Returns
`GenomicPathResult{T}`: Optimal path with performance metrics

# Algorithm Details
1. **Dual Search**: Forward search from source, reverse search from target
2. **Intersection Detection**: Stops when search frontiers meet
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Combines forward and reverse paths at meeting point
4. **Strand Awareness**: Handles reverse complement sequences automatically

# Performance Characteristics
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^(d/2)) vs O(b^d) for unidirectional search
- **Memory Efficiency**: Two smaller frontiers instead of one large one
- **Genomic Optimization**: ~4-10x speedup for typical assembly graph distances

# Examples
```julia
# Fast pathfinding for long genomic distances
result = bidirectional_genomic_dijkstra(graph, source_idx, target_idx, kmers, coverage)

# Compare performance with unidirectional search
uni_result = genomic_dijkstra(graph, source_idx, target_idx, kmers, coverage)
speedup = uni_result.execution_time / result.execution_time

"""
    reconstruct_genomic_sequence(path::Vector{T}, k::Int) where T

Reconstruct genomic sequence from k-mer path using overlap-based assembly.

# Arguments
- `path::Vector{T}`: Path of k-mers (strings or BioSequences)
- `k::Int`: K-mer size

# Returns
`String`: Assembled genomic sequence

# Algorithm Details
Assumes consecutive k-mers have (k-1) overlap, assembling by taking the first
k-mer completely and then adding the last nucleotide of each subsequent k-mer.
