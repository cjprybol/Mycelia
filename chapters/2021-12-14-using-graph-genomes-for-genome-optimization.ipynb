    "\n",
    "Now that we have the ability to sequence as many genomes as the research community can afford to pay\n",
    "for, and that there are so many genomes publicly available online, we are now\n",
    "in a situation where we can learn what regions of genomes contribute to what\n",
    "kind of phenotypic properties by associating measured attributes with the\n",
    "co-occurrence of genetic features even for non-model and unculturable\n",
    "organisms. When building these models initially, there are no causal attributes\n",
    "that can necessarily be attributed because we are simply looking for\n",
    "correlative relationships of phenotypic traits appearing in the presence of or\n",
    "in the absence of specific genetic features. Given the ability to associate\n",
    "genetic features with phenotypic features that may be desirable or undesirable,\n",
    "we are given the opportunity to use graph pan genomes as vehicles for genetic\n",
    "optimization driven entirely by data. These non-causal relationships can be\n",
    "expanded upon over time with additional information that is derived from causal\n",
    "analysis conducted statistically and/or via direct experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a weighted\n",
    "graph structure that enables the attribution of specific expected properties to\n",
    "paths through the graph (genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes), there may be\n",
    "situations in which it may be desirable to modify and manipulate genomes to\n",
    "have them manifest these desirable characteristics in an actual organism. For\n",
    "example, it may be desired to encode features that are most consistent with\n",
    "outcomes such as health and longevity (humans), avirulence/lack of\n",
    "pathogenicity (pathogens/microbes/viruses), as well as having the smallest\n",
    "essential (minimal) genome (biomanufacturing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a\n",
    "pangenomegraph with weights where the weights are proportional to an\n",
    "optimizeable measure such as correlation, likelihood, frequency, etc., the\n",
    "question becomes how do we find the optimal path through this genome graph such\n",
    "that the average score is maximized so that we can test whether the predictive\n",
    "value of the graph can manifest the desired outcomes if the genome was encoded\n",
    "in a living organism.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of\n",
    "writing, the optimization algorithms that I am aware of only operate on the\n",
    "weights of the edges. For example, there are many optimization algorithms that\n",
    "find the shortest path between two nodes. Examples include A-star, djikstra,\n",
    "bellman-Ford, traveling salesman problem (note that traveling salesman problem\n",
    "assumes a cyclic optimization which is very helpful specifically when dealing\n",
    "with circular genomes such as those of phage bacteria or other prokaryotic\n",
    "organisms). Given that we don’t have a plethora of optimization algorithms that\n",
    "account for edge weights and node weights (aside from hidden Markov models\n",
    "which become impractical at very large graph sizes common in pangenomics), we\n",
    "will look at the node optimization and path optimization components of our goal\n",
    "individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will first ask\n",
    "the question \"which nodes do we want to include?\", which can be done\n",
    "by setting a threshold and only retaining nodes that meet that threshold,\n",
    "clustering (supervised and/or unsupervised), and likely many more methods.\n",
    "Given the set of nodes of interest, we can induce a subgraph containing just\n",
    "those nodes and then find the optimal or a sufficiently optimal path through\n",
    "the subset of remaining nodes that maximizes the overall optimization that we\n",
    "are trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem of\n",
    "trying to find the minimally sized genome, our node optimization is relative\n",
    "frequency of genes contained in all known entities of a given species or other\n",
    "phylogenetic level of classification (threshold = must be contained in 100% of observed\n",
    "entities). In this same problem, the path optimization is the shortest viable\n",
    "path of observed possible paths that includes all of these nodes. Further\n",
    "possible optimization can be done if we are willing to consider connections\n",
    "that have not yet been observed (e.g. gene fusions and assumptions that\n",
    "non-coding elements between genes are themselves non-essential).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the\n",
    "structure necessary for this optimization, we will first build a pan genome\n",
    "graph that includes the DNA kmers, gene annotations + amino acid kmers, and the\n",
    "pathways that they encode. We can then look at the relative feature space in\n",
    "all three of these levels. The highest and most abstract level is that of the\n",

    "non-abstract, however in practice we are unable to unambiguously resolve and\n",

    "would build on a foundation of an RNA pangenome/pantranscriptome). The key\n",
    "advantage of constraining in the pathway and protein layers of abstraction is\n",
    "the dimensionality reduction provided. A genome may contain billions of nucleic\n",
