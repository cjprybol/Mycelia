# Comprehensive Correctness Testing for All 24 Graph Variants
#
# This test suite validates:
# 1. Graph structure correctness (vertices, edges, labels, orientations)
# 2. Path reconstruction (expected paths + rediscovery)
# 3. Round-trip I/O (write/read identity preservation)
# 4. Quality score handling (retention, joint probabilities, provenance)
# 5. Graph simplification pipeline preparation
