## 4. Technical Specifications & Implementation Details

### 4.1. Graph Type Hierarchy Specification
**Source:** `ASSEMBLY_ROADMAP.md`

#### Fixed-Length Graphs (Assembly Foundation)
- **N-gram Graphs**: Unicode text analysis foundation based on ngram vertices connected by n-1 edge overlaps observed in the dataset
- **K-mer Graphs**: Type-stable `Kmers.DNAKmer{K}` vertices with NO string conversions and edges based on K-1 overlaps between kmers observed in the dataset
- **Qualmer Graphs**: Quality-aware k-mers preserving PHRED scores and edges based on K-1 overlaps between qualmers observed in the dataset

#### Variable-Length Graphs (Simplified Products)  
- **String Graphs**: Variable-length unicode strings from N-gram simplification or direct creation from Strings via overlap-layout-consensus
- **FASTA Graphs**: `BioSequences.LongDNA/RNA/AA` from k-mer simplification or direct creation from FASTA records via overlap-layout-consensus
- **FASTQ Graphs**: Quality-preserving BioSequences with per-base scores from qualmer graph simplification or direct creation from FASTQ records via overlap-layout-consensus

#### Qualmer Implementation Requirements
*   **Core Type**:
    ```julia
    struct Qualmer{K}
        sequence::BioSequences.DNAKmer{K}
        quality_scores::Vector{Int8}  # PHRED scores
        observations::Set{QualmerObservation}
        joint_probability::Float64    # Joint confidence in k-mer existence
    end
    ```

#### Joint Probability Calculation
When a k-mer is observed multiple times with different quality scores:
- Convert PHRED scores to probabilities: `p = 10^(-phred/10)`
- Calculate joint probability of k-mer correctness across all observations
- Use log-space arithmetic for numerical stability
- Example: 3 observations at 99% confidence each → joint confidence > 99%

#### Probabilistic Algorithms
- **Probabilistic walks** with configurable transition probabilities
- **Shortest path algorithms** where distance ∝ (1 - probability)
- **Maximum likelihood/weight walks** for high-confidence path finding
- **Viterbi maximum likelihood** path inference

### 4.2. Unified Assembly Interface
**Source:** `ASSEMBLY_ROADMAP.md`

A high-level API for common assembly tasks.
```julia
function assemble_genome(reads; method=:qualmer_graph, k=31, error_rate=0.01)
function polish_assembly(assembly, reads; iterations=3)
function validate_assembly(assembly, reference=nothing)
```

### 4.3. Intelligent Self-Optimizing Assembly System 🔵
**Source:** `ASSEMBLY_ROADMAP.md`

#### Strategic Vision:
**Create a learnable, self-optimizing assembler** that uses reinforcement learning to eliminate manual parameter tuning while maximizing assembly accuracy. The system will learn optimal assembly strategies through cross-validation and simulated training, making intelligent decisions about k-mer selection, error correction, and termination conditions.

#### Core Philosophy:
- **Accuracy-First**: Prioritize assembly accuracy over contiguity or speed
- **Dynamic k-mer Selection**: Iteratively process prime k-mer sizes until corrections stop
- **Cross-Validation**: Use 5-10 fold validation to create trusted consensus assemblies
- **Learnable Parameters**: Train on diverse simulated datasets to generalize to real data
- **Sparsity-Based Optimization**: Use sparsity detection to find optimal starting k-mer sizes

#### Architecture: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Multiple Approaches
**1. High-Level Policy (Meta-Controller)**:
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay
- **State**: Overall assembly quality, current k-mer size, memory usage, correction rate
- **Actions**: Continue with current k, move to next prime k, or terminate
- **Termination**: Based on correction rate, memory limits (32GB), or max k (~101)

**2. Low-Level Policy (Error Correction Controller)**:
- **Algorithm**: Policy Gradient (PPO) for continuous parameter spaces
- **State**: Local graph topology, quality scores, coverage patterns
- **Actions**: Viterbi parameters, path selection strategies, confidence thresholds
- **Integration**: Uses existing Viterbi + probabilistic path algorithms

**3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (Game-Based Assembly)** 🆕:
- **Algorithm**: UCB1-based tree search with simulated rollouts
- **Game Formulation**: Assembly as sequential decision game with known target (training)
- **State**: Current partial assembly, available reads, quality metrics
- **Actions**: Read selection, overlap decisions, path extensions
- **Reward**: Accuracy vs. known reference (weighted 1000x) + efficiency metrics
- **Rollout Policy**: Fast heuristic assembly for leaf node evaluation
- **Selection**: UCB1 balancing exploration vs exploitation

#### Implementation Phases:
**Foundation (High Priority)**
- a: Iterative prime k-mer progression algorithm
- b: Accuracy-prioritized reward function
- c: Cross-validation pipeline for quality assessment

**Learning System (Medium Priority)**
- a: RL environment for assembly decision making
- b: Simulation framework for training on diverse datasets
- c: Policy networks for parameter optimization

**Visualization & Automation (Medium Priority)**
- a: Decision pathway visualization showing confidence levels
- b: Automated parameter selection based on learned policies
- c: Real-time quality assessment during assembly
- d: Interactive tools for exploring assembly decisions

#### Key Algorithms:
**Dynamic k-mer Selection**:
```julia
function mycelia_assemble(reads; max_k=101, memory_limit=32_000_000_000)
    k = find_initial_k(reads)  # First prime k with sparsity
    while k <= max_k
        graph = build_qualmer_graph(reads, k=k)
        corrections_made = correct_errors_at_k(graph, k)
        if !should_continue_k(graph, corrections_made, k)
            k = next_prime_k(k)
        end
    end
    return finalize_assembly(graphs)
end
```

### 4.4. Iterative Maximum Likelihood Assembly Module
**Source:** `ASSEMBLY_ROADMAP.md`

#### Strategic Vision: Statistical Path Resampling Assembly
**Create an iterative assembly module** that complements the intelligent assembly system by using statistical path resampling and maximum likelihood approaches for read-level error correction.

#### Core Philosophy:
- **Sparsity-Based Initialization**: Use same sparsity assessment as intelligent assembly for starting k
- **Read-Level Correction**: Consider each read individually for statistical path improvement
- **Maximum Likelihood Approach**: Replace reads with higher likelihood paths proportionally
- **Iterative Prime Progression**: Like intelligent assembly, iterate through prime k-mer sizes
- **Viterbi Integration**: Leverage existing viterbi-next.jl algorithms for path finding

#### Algorithm Flow:
1. **Initialize**: Find starting prime k using sparsity assessment.
2. **For each prime k**:
   - Build qualmer graph from current read set.
   - For each read, find its path likelihood, search for higher-likelihood alternatives using Viterbi, and replace the read proportionally to the likelihood improvement.
   - Write the entire updated read set to a new, timestamped FASTQ file.
   - Continue until corrections saturate, then move to the next prime k.
3. **Output**: A series of timestamped FASTQ files showing read evolution.
