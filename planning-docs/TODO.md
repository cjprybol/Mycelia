# Mycelia Rhizomorph Implementation TODO

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING

**Test-First Approach Validates Concerns**: Initial testing reveals that claiming work "complete" without tests was premature. First comprehensive test run discovered:

1. **API Mismatch**: Rhizomorph functions exist but weren't accessible (no exports, wrong API assumptions)
2. **Real Bugs Found**: 4/42 path finding tests fail, revealing:
   - Bubble/branching graph algorithm issues
   - DoubleStrand mode k-mer connectivity broken
   - Incorrect error handling
3. **Documentation Gap**: Planning docs claimed Phase 1-3 "complete" but ~50% was actually untested

**Conclusion**: The rigorous test-first approach was absolutely necessary. Without it, we would have moved forward with broken implementations.

---

## Executive Summary

The Rhizomorph graph ecosystem has **substantial implementation (~7,000 lines) and excellent documentation (94% coverage)**, but has **critical testing gaps (~40% coverage)**. We cannot consider work "complete" without comprehensive tests. This document tracks the work needed to reach production-ready status.

### Current State

| Component | Status | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Implementation** | 85% Complete | ~7,000 lines of Rhizomorph code |
| **Documentation** | 94% Complete | All user-facing functions documented |
| **Testing** | 40% Complete | ❌ CRITICAL GAP |

### Quality Standard

A feature is ✅ **COMPLETE** only if ALL THREE criteria are met:
1. ✅ Implementation exists with working logic (not stub)
2. ✅ Docstring present with examples
3. ✅ Comprehensive tests pass (including edge cases)

---

## Critical Findings

### What Works Well ✅

**Data Structures (100% tested)**
- All 4 evidence entry types (EvidenceEntry, QualityEvidenceEntry, EdgeEvidenceEntry, EdgeQualityEvidenceEntry)
- All 6 vertex data types (Kmer, Qualmer, BioSequence, QualityBioSequence, String, QualityString)
- All 6 edge data types
- Nested Dict evidence structure with O(1) queries
- Quality score functions (Phred math, aggregation)

- ❌ Simplification (detect_bubbles_next) - NO TESTS FOUND
- ❌ I/O roundtrip (GFA export/import) - UNCLEAR STATUS

**Incomplete Graph Construction Testing**

- ❌ Variable-length OLC graphs - Implementation exists, tests unknown
- ❌ N-gram graphs - Implementation exists, tests unknown

## 🔍 OLD PLANNING DOCUMENT VERIFICATION (2025-01-25)

**See**: `planning-docs/VERIFICATION_FINDINGS.md` for full details

**Key Discoveries from Systematic Verification**:

### ✅ Good News - More Code Than Expected
- Most claimed implementations DO exist with substantial code (900-1,200+ lines each)
- intelligent-assembly.jl (964 lines) EXISTS
- iterative-assembly.jl (1,218 lines) EXISTS and is ACCESSIBLE
- 4 reinforcement learning implementations (1,253+ lines each) EXIST
- cross-validation.jl EXISTS
- Simulation, quality control, and algorithm files EXIST

### 🚨 Critical Issues Discovered
1. **Many implementations are COMMENTED OUT** in src/Mycelia.jl:
   - Line 120: intelligent-assembly.jl (DISABLED despite existing)
   - Line 129: cross-validation.jl (DISABLED)
   - Lines 133-137: ALL 4 reinforcement learning files (DISABLED)

2. **Zero Tests for Most Claimed Features**:
   - No tests for intelligent-assembly.jl (claimed "complete")
   - No tests for iterative-assembly.jl (accessible but untested!)
   - No tests for cross-validation.jl (claimed "89/89 tests passing" - FALSE!)

3. **ALL Tool Integration Claims Are False**:
   - ❌ QUAST, BUSCO, MUMmer - NOT FOUND
   - ❌ GATK, Freebayes, Clair3, BCFtools - NOT FOUND
   - ❌ PGGB, Cactus, vg toolkit - NOT FOUND
   - ❌ metaFlye, hifiasm-meta, SKESA, IDBA-UD - NOT FOUND
   - ❌ HyLight, STRONG, Strainy - NOT FOUND
   - **Total**: 17+ claimed tool wrappers, 0 actually exist

### 📊 Verification Summary
- **Implementations**: Higher quality than expected (many are substantial, not placeholders)
- **Accessibility**: Lower than claimed (~40% commented out and inaccessible)
- **Testing**: Even accessible code often has zero tests
- **False Claims**: Tool integrations and "89/89 tests" demonstrably false

### 🎯 Immediate Actions Added to Roadmap
1. **Test Accessible Implementations** (before continuing with Rhizomorph):
   - [ ] Create tests for iterative-assembly.jl (1,218 lines, accessible but untested)
   - [ ] Verify viterbi-next.jl has tests
   - [ ] Test simulation functions
   - [ ] Test quality control functions

2. **Test and Uncomment High-Value Code**:
   - [ ] Create tests for intelligent-assembly.jl (964 lines)
   - [ ] If tests pass, uncomment in src/Mycelia.jl:120
   - [ ] Create tests for cross-validation.jl
   - [ ] If tests pass, uncomment in src/Mycelia.jl:129

3. **Documentation Cleanup**:
   - [ ] Remove false tool integration claims from old planning docs
   - [ ] Correct "89/89 tests passing" claim
   - [ ] Add warnings about commented-out code

**Conclusion**: Old planning docs overstated completion. Code quality is good, but accessibility and testing are the gaps.

---

## Approach: Rigorous Test-First Validation

**Philosophy**: Test everything, fix failures, then update docs based on tested reality.

**User Requirements**:
- ✅ 100% critical path coverage before marking anything complete
- ✅ Test-first approach (write tests → fix failures → document)
- ✅ Remove old code only after new code proven

**Timeline**: 4 weeks to production-ready status

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Establish baseline before adding Rhizomorph to comparisons

### 3.5.1 PhiX174 Benchmarking Framework
**File**: `benchmarking/phix174_assembler_comparison.jl` ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Core framework implemented, bugs identified and partially fixed

**Completed**:
- [x] PhiX174 reference download using `Mycelia.download_genome_by_accession()`
- [x] Read simulation (ART Illumina 100x, Badread PacBio 50x)
- [x] Platform detection and filtering (macOS vs Linux)
- [x] Comparison framework for 8 assemblers:
  - Short-read: SPAdes, SKESA, MEGAHIT (Linux-only), metaSPAdes
  - Long-read: Flye, Canu, metaFlye, metaMDBG
- [x] Metrics calculation (N50, contig count, total length, runtime)
- [x] FastANI integration for genome comparison
- [x] Plots generation (N50, runtime, identity)
- [x] CSV export

**Issues Fixed**:
- [x] Wrapper return values (Flye, Canu, metaFlye) - changed `assembly=` to `contigs=`
- [x] metaMDBG function signature - added `hifi_reads` parameter handling
- [x] Platform checks - MEGAHIT filtered for Linux-only
- [x] Refactored to use existing Mycelia functions instead of duplicating code

**Known Issues** (deferred to next session):
- [ ] Short-read assemblers failing on macOS (SPAdes, SKESA, metaSPAdes)
- [ ] metaMDBG errors on PhiX174 (likely genome size too small)
- [ ] Some assemblers may have platform-specific issues

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Debug remaining assembler failures
- [ ] Validate all assemblers complete successfully
- [ ] Expand to larger genomes (bacterial, archaeal)
- [ ] Add Rhizomorph to comparison suite
