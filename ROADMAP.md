- External tool integration (MEGAHIT, SPAdes, fastp, etc.)
- K-mer analysis infrastructure  
- Read simulation capabilities
- Intelligent and iterative assembly algorithms
- Reinforcement learning framework (3 implementations)

### What Needs Work ⚠️
- Basic quality control functions (native Julia implementations)
- Assembly validation and metrics
- Visualization capabilities
- Gene annotation integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Stable testing framework

## Assembly Innovation Summary 🧬

Mycelia includes cutting-edge assembly algorithms that represent significant research contributions:

### Novel 6-Graph Type Hierarchy
- **Fixed-length**: N-gram, K-mer, and Qualmer graphs for initial assembly
- **Variable-length**: String, FASTA, and FASTQ graphs for simplified products
- **Quality preservation**: Per-base PHRED scores maintained throughout assembly

### Three Assembly Strategies  
- **Intelligent Assembly**: Prime k-mer progression with sparsity detection
- **Iterative Maximum Likelihood**: Statistical path resampling with Viterbi
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Self-optimizing parameter selection (3 implementations)

### Key Scientific Advances
- First framework to preserve quality scores throughout assembly
- Zero string conversions for type safety and efficiency
- Cross-validation pipeline for assembly confidence
- Hierarchical RL for automated parameter tuning

These research components are largely complete and tested. The roadmap below focuses on building the supporting infrastructure needed for a production-ready package.
