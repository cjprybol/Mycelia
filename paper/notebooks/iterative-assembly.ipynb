    "# Iterative Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook shows some small examples of the assembly approach that I have been developing that I call iterative assembly. The approach works by first building a de-bruijn assembly graph of the sequenced DNA. The approach then utilizes that assembly graph as a probablistic model to perform error correction via the viterbi algorithm on the reads in the dataset to drastically reduce error rates and improve assembly accuracy. By correcting most errors using relatively short kmers, and then progressively working up to longer kmers that help resolve more repeats, it is possible to avoid a common issue during the genome assembly process where most kmers in the dataset are erroneous, as well as to overcome the sequencing accuracy limitations of long read nanopore sequencers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be helpful to first start by looking at the initial assembly graph figure, which is laid out using a breadth-first search traversal. The deeper the graph, the more complexity (e.g. errors) are present. As the errors are removed during the iterative correction process, the graph flattens out and widens into a relatively easy to resolve assembly graph with few, if any, remaing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, I am assuming the error rates to be 1/(k+1) (the default when the user does not provide a known error rate). Note the inferred error rate is generally truer to the true error rate than the assumed error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experiments, I have found that iteratively assembling and correcting at a given k until no more corrections are performed and then incrementing k is the most effective way to remove errors. When two consecutive iterations do not produce any error corrections, the process can be halted and a final genome assembly produced (variants, coverage depths, closest known species, and other attributes can also be produced at this point)."
