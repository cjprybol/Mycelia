# # Tutorial 2: Quality Control and Preprocessing
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to assess and improve the quality of genomic data
# before analysis. Quality control is essential for ensuring reliable downstream results.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:
# - How to assess sequencing data quality using multiple metrics
# - Common quality issues and their biological implications
# - Preprocessing techniques for improving data quality
# - Statistical approaches for quality assessment
# - Best practices for quality control in different analysis types

# ## Part 1: Understanding Quality Metrics
#
# Quality assessment involves multiple metrics that capture different aspects
# of data quality. Understanding these metrics helps identify problems and
# guide preprocessing decisions.

# ### Phred Quality Scores
#
# Phred scores represent the probability of base-calling errors:
# - Q10 = 10% error rate (1 in 10 bases wrong)
# - Q20 = 1% error rate (1 in 100 bases wrong)  
# - Q30 = 0.1% error rate (1 in 1000 bases wrong)
# - Q40 = 0.01% error rate (1 in 10,000 bases wrong)

println("Quality Score Interpretation:")
println("Q10: 10% error rate (poor quality)")
println("Q20: 1% error rate (acceptable)")
println("Q30: 0.1% error rate (good quality)")
println("Q40: 0.01% error rate (excellent quality)")

# ### Sequence Composition
#
# Analyze nucleotide composition for bias detection

# Generate test sequences with different quality characteristics
sequences = [
    ("High Quality", Mycelia.random_fasta_record(moltype=:DNA, seed=1, L=1000)),
    ("AT-Rich", Mycelia.random_fasta_record(moltype=:DNA, seed=2, L=1000)),  # TODO: Add AT bias
    ("GC-Rich", Mycelia.random_fasta_record(moltype=:DNA, seed=3, L=1000)),  # TODO: Add GC bias
]

for (name, seq) in sequences
    seq_str = String(FASTX.sequence(seq))
    
    # Calculate composition
    a_count = count(c -> c == 'A', seq_str)
    t_count = count(c -> c == 'T', seq_str)
    g_count = count(c -> c == 'G', seq_str)
    c_count = count(c -> c == 'C', seq_str)
    
    at_content = (a_count + t_count) / length(seq_str)
    gc_content = (g_count + c_count) / length(seq_str)
