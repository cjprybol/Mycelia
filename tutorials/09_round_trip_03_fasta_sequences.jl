# # Round-Trip Tutorial 3: FASTA Sequences → Sequence Graphs → Reconstruction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates the complete round-trip workflow for biological sequence analysis
# using Mycelia's BioSequence graph system. We'll work with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences,
# showing how to construct variable-length sequence graphs and reconstruct the original 
# biological sequences with high fidelity.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# By the end of this tutorial, you will:
# 1. Construct BioSequence graphs from FASTA files containing biological sequences
# 2. Understand the difference between BioSequence and string-based approaches
# 3. Perform high-quality biological sequence reconstruction
# 4. Validate reconstruction accuracy with biological sequence metrics
# 5. Apply sequence graphs to real genomic assembly problems
# 6. Compare performance across different biological alphabets (DNA, RNA, protein)

import Mycelia
import FASTX
import BioSequences
import Statistics
import Random

# ## Biological Sequence Preparation
#
# Create diverse biological test datasets representing real-world genomic scenarios.
