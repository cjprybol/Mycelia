## Creating probabilistic assemblies
1. Build weighted [de-bruijn graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph) with observed data
2. Use the weighted de-bruijn graph as a [hidden markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to [error correct observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm)
3. Use the error-corrected observations to build a new, more accurate weighted de-bruijn graph
4. Repeat 1-3 until convergence
5. Return maximum likelihood assembly

Consider for graph cleaning:
  - [x] Solve most likely path (slow but robust) vs
  - [ ] resample most likely paths (fast, less theoretically sound)
    - fairly certain that this is what the Flye assembler does


## Implementation requirements

- kmer spectra -> signal detection
- kmer size with signal -> initial assembly graph
    - bandage visualization
- initial assembly graph + reads -> iterative assembly
    - bandage visualization
- final assembly
    - bandage visualization
- annotation
    - find all start codons
    - find all stop codons
    - report in fasta format all coding regions
    - try and verify against prodigal to make sure that we arenâ€™t missing any

- graph -> path -> sequence -> amino acid sequence

## API

- Need to allow users to add individual datasets to database
- does a sequence exist?
  - does a sequence exist allowing n mismatches
  - relative likelihood and frequency of most similar paths
    - this is just the viterbi traversal
- reads supporting traversal, and the datasets they came from
- connected components (species) containing path
- phylogenetic hierarchy of a component
  - nodes <-> kmers
- which datasets are a given kmer present in?
- export and import with GFA
- condense kmer graphs to simplified graphs
- visualization 
  - with Bandage (works automatically with GFA)
  - with Neo4J visualization library
